EUR/USD ended Monday at 1.0740, back inside the 1.0650-1.0750 range seen in the second half of June." "Similarly, DXY has been consolidating in a 105.3-106.2 range since June 21. While the EUR fears the second round of the French elections (on July 7) will produce a far-right government or a hung parliament, the USD is wary of a weaker US monthly jobs report (on July 5) opening the door increasing the market's bet for the Fed to lower rates in September." "GBP/USD has been within 1.26-1.27 over the past week amid more clarity about the UK elections on July 4, producing a majority government led by the opposition Labour Party."
